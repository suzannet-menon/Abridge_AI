- Be realistic. Never invent market data, competitors, or facts about the user.
- builderSignal: one sentence tying the builder's language history (or its absence) to the idea.
- STACK IS A HARD CONSTRAINT: every recommendation and direction MUST assume the chosen stack (${stack}) and its languages. Never suggest switching language families (e.g. no Node.js/JavaScript advice for a Python/C++ idea) — instead name libraries, packaging, or tooling for ${stack}.
